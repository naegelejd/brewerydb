			"description": "The Flying Dog Legend begins in 1983, and like every good legend there are several versions of this tale. The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.",

			"description": "Today, Sea Dog Brewing Company operates brew pubs in two locations. The Sea Dog in Topsham occupies a scenic spot on the Androscoggin River. The Bangor location overlooks the historic Penobscot River. Both locations serve a full menu of handcrafted ales and creative pub fare with a flair. Being authentic is important to us. Our beers are brewed in a traditional style using only the highest quality ingredients like imported English two-row malted barley and British top-fermenting yeast. Our English brewing style results in brews with a distinctive, refreshing taste and crisp finish unique to top-fermented beers.",

The bottles are now available at both pubs and in liquor stores around the state.",
