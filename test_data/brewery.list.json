			"description": "W\u00f6lffer Estate Vineyard is unquestionably a beautiful place. But the creation of it spanned over three decades and required a creative vision, an ability to bring dreams to reality and a great deal of dedicated hard work by many people. Christian W\u00f6lffer possessed the vision and, with the meticulous care of his professional team, built this special place \u2013 W\u00f6lffer Estate Vineyard.\r\n\r\nThe original parcel of land was a potato farm with an old farmhouse in what is now the middle of the estate. Over the years, as more acres were acquired, paddocks and stables were added and, in 1988, the vineyard was founded. This 55-acre vineyard is part of a 175-acre estate with boarding stables, 30 paddocks, an indoor jumping ring, and a Grand Prix field. Both the stables and winery have a European character and, from these former potato fields, world-class wines have come forth. W\u00f6lffer Estate Vineyard is an American winery in the classic European tradition.",
