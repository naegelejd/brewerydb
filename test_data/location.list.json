				"description": "As Natives of West Virginia, it has long been our dream to bring quality hand-crafted beer back to our state.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Elkins and Helvetia, we were raised on easy drinking beers and homemade wine. Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.\r\n\r\nSince then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nThat's our story so far. Thank you for all the great support we've received pursuing our dream.\r\n\r\n- Brian & Willie",

				"description": "Welcome to Brewer\u2019s Alley, Frederick, Maryland\u2019s first Brewpub. Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.",

				"description": "An interest in history and beer led Bob and Ellie Tupper to  a quest throughout the United States and Europe to talk to brewers and sample classic examples of traditional brewing styles.  In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made\u2014one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Ale was the result.  \r\n\r\nIn 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.  The Tuppers still travel and taste beers and now have notes on over 14,000 different brews.",

Stephen Demzcuk, owner of the Baltimore Washington Beer Works and their popular, Raven Special Lager, has joined forces with J. Hollis B. Albert III, a local Baltimore businessman, and Patrick Beille of France, to bring this dream to life.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.",

Of the millions who visit, a few are distracted by romantic visions of life at the beach and are left behind, never to return to the \"real world.\" It's an existence unaffected by time or authority. Days and nights blend together, signaled by sunrises over the ocean and sunsets in the bay. Their hearts become gorged with rebellion and pride, inherent in all Americans but enjoyed by few. It is with the same celebration of freedom and togetherness that we have conceived this beer. We brew our beer in the salty air with our toes in the sand and the sun on our faces.

				"description": "Hi there! We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.",

Starting in 1910, the building housed the Hyattsville Hardware Co. which stayed in continuous operation until 1992. In its heyday, the hardware Co. was the center of community activity, selling everything from pots and pans to remedies for livestock maladies, chicken feed and of course, nuts and bolts. Many people bought their first washing machines and iceboxes here. Trains from Baltimore stopped right out back and delivered loads of lumber, stacks of seed, even whole houses from the Sears catalog. Neighbors gathered and talked about the weather, the schools, rising prices and changing times",

Importing beer into Luxembourg, boxing it up and shipping it within the EU.  One supplier of his beers was Wolfgang Stark of Haus de 131 Biere.  Wolfgang imported beer from all over the world. He supplied Ngoma from Togo, Flame from New Zealand, and Lapin Kulta from Finland.   One day Wolfgang asked Stephen if he would like to make a beer in Germany and using an American marketing theme.  It took Stephen just a second to say yes and a day to come up with The Raven.  The new company was registered in Baltimore and the new beer was eventually produced in Nagold, Germany and called in honor of Baltimore's Edgar Allan Poe The Raven Special Lager.",
