Subtle malt sweetness is balanced with noticeable hop flavor, light raisin and mildly spicy, cake-like flavors, and is finished with local wildflower honey aromas. Made with 80% Organic Malted Barley, Belgian Specialty grains, Forbidden Fruit yeast, domestic hops and Round Rock local wildflower honey, this beer is deceptively high in alcohol.",

				"description": "Belgian pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for a beer of its alcoholic strength. Often brewed with light colored Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

The full, moderately bright mouthfeel starts  with cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel malt, then yields Madagascar vanilla bean, oak, and brandy flavors.

These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.",

This hop-centric beer became the jumping-off point for other intense flavors.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

				"description": "Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color. Often, though not always, brewed with dark Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers can be well attenuated, ranging from medium to full-bodied. The perception of hop bitterness is low to medium, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. Fruity complexity along with the soft flavors of roasted malts add distinct character. The alcohol strength of these beers can often be deceiving to the senses. The intensity of malt character can be rich, creamy, and sweet with intensities ranging from medium to high. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

			"description": "This is a special brew that Brewmaster Glen Sprouse first formulated and brewed for his wedding in 2001. It is brewed with a Saison yeast that is very attenuative. It is also dosed with a british ale yeast late in primary fermentation to \"clean it up a little\" and then an Abbey yeast is added for secondary fermentation. The base malt is all German Pilsener and Munich Malt (as is the typical practice of most of the high quality Belgian brewers of pale beers) with a bit of red winter wheat thrown in for body and mouthfeel and just a touch of coriander for the finish. We use a little Belgian Light Candi Sugar and a little Special B Malt to add to the Belgian character. Five mash rests are employed to improve the clarity, pH and distribution of sugars. And, four hop additions are made in the boil using a combination of German, Styrian and Czech Hops. This beer gets considerably better with about six months to a year under its belt. 5 Seasons will be serving it throughout this period, slowly meting out the kegs on a monthly basis to ensure it lasts until next year's batch is ready.",

The beer greets your palate with a solid malt body of sweet caramel, balanced by an assertive hop bitterness. We then round out the flavor using traditional American hop varieties that contribute a beautiful quality of wild flowers and delicate fruit. Those delicious hop flavors mingle on the tongue with the vanilla and tannic nuances of American oak. The beer finishes dry, but the deliciousness of the hops and oak linger a bit leaving you longing for another sip.\r\n\r\nThis beer is also being placed in American Oak barrels for aging. The barrel-aged version of Ale of the Hermit is set for release late summer 2014.",

Primary fermentation was followed by a cold maturation or \"garding\" period of six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe resulting beer is a medium amber colored ale with a smooth lager quality. The aroma presents a complex earthiness and toasted grains, balanced by a fruity candied grape character.

Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",
