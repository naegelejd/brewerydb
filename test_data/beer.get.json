		"description": "Full Disclosure: This beer came to fruition because we saw a gap in our portfolio and we wanted to increase our market share. Sometimes the truth hurts. But most often, it\u2019s damn refreshing. The Truth Imperial IPA--the latest addition to our year-round portfolio-is a hop bomb of some of the most distinct Pacific Northwest hops available today. Its sharp hop bitterness begins with huge pine notes on the nose, which evolve into bright citrus (think grapefruit) and subtle stone fruit flavors.",

			"description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",
